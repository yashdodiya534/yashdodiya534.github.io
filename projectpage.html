Hi all! Here is my first complete data analysis project using data from the T20 World Cup, which
was provided via codebasics.

To accomplish the project with the Alien team, the best T20 cricket team from the T20 WorldCup
(2022) must be found.

1. Context: Aliens enjoy cricket and watch cricket games.
To relinquish the earth or risk destroying it, they called Nickpuri, Chief of F.I.E.L.D.
The earth is yours if aliens defeat Team "Earth" in a cricket match, and if they lose, they must
work as interns in any IT business, according to Nickpuri's condition after negotiations.
2. Task: We must build a team that can Score at least 180 runs per game on average 150 runs
should be needed to defeat Alien.
3. Take action:
1 Web scrape data from the ESPN website.
2. Pandas, a Python library for data transformation.
3 Power Query data transformation.
4. Using DAX, model data and create parameters.
5. Create dashboards for fast bowlers, all-rounders, middle-order batsmen, finishers, and
openers.

Result:
Hopefully, This dashboard helps to make data-driven decisions in Team selection and Team "Earth"
to defeat aliens.
crucial cricket terms used on the dashboard
1) Batting average: The typical number of runs scored per inning.
2)Strike Rate is the number of runs scored for every 100 balls.
3) Total Number of Batted Innings
4)Boundary%:% runs that are scored at the boundary.
4) The average run conceded per over in bowling
5)Bowling Strike Rate: Avg. No. of Balls Needed to Get a Catch
No. of runs permitted per wicket in bowling
Dot ball (%): bowled dot balls.

What I learned about the whole project:
1) How to use web scraping to gather information from any website.
2) Python Pandas data cleansing techniques.
How important are factors like the color of the dashboard theme, the primary and secondary
colors, the font style and size, and the aspect ratio of the photos when developing your
dashboards?
